This repository contains my **personal cybersecurity and systems laboratories**.

It focuses on understanding how **vulnerabilities and defenses emerge** at the  
**operating system, memory, and network levels**, through hands-on labs, experiments,
and small security-oriented tools.

This work is strongly influenced by my background in  
**low-level programming in C** and the **project-based learning methodology** of the  
**42 Network (1337)**.

## 🧠 About

Hi, I’m **Ouail**, a Software Engineering student at  
**1337 (42 Network)**.

My main technical interests include:

- 🐧 Linux internals & operating system behavior  
- 🧠 Memory management & binary-level vulnerabilities  
- 🌐 Networking & protocol analysis  
- 🔐 Secure software and systems design  

Alongside my software engineering studies, I train independently in
**cybersecurity and penetration testing**, with an emphasis on
**understanding systems deeply before attacking or defending them**.

My long-term goal is to become a  
**security-focused systems and software engineer**, with a later specialization
in **offensive security**.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a **progressive lab environment**:

- 📁 `00-profile/`  
  Entry point and short personal overview of the lab environment.

- 📁 `01-systems/`  
  Low-level systems labs (shells, allocators, tracing, process and OS tools).

- 📁 `02-networks/`  
  Network internals, packet analysis, scanners, and protocol experiments.

- 📁 `03-security-engineering/`  
  Vulnerable labs and secure prototypes to study attack surfaces and defensive design.

- 📁 `04-exploitation/`  
  Controlled exploitation labs (stack, heap, ROP, and kernel-level experiments).

- 📁 `05-defensive-security/`  
  Detection, logging, monitoring, and basic intrusion-detection tooling.

- 📁 `06-pentest-labs/`  
  End-to-end penetration testing practice labs and reporting methodology.

- 📁 `07-research/`  
  Exploratory security research (fuzzing, side-channels, emerging attack surfaces).

- 📁 `08-tools/`  
  Supporting security and analysis tools developed during the labs.

- 📁 `09-ctf-writeups/`  
  Public CTF write-ups used as structured learning material.
